# E-Authentication
ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM USING QR CODE AND OTP.


Our project makes use of qr-code and otp both at the same time in the form of two-factor authentication to authenticate true user.

Modules:
- Login
- Signup / Register
- Two Factor Authentication

The user first needs to signup in order to connect to us.

After successful registration, the user can then login from the login page.

If the login credentials are valid then the user will be sent to a 2-factor authentication page.
In that page he/she must enter the otp received on the registered email and the qr-code which is generated in the D-drive of the users system.
--> D:/QR

After successful validation of 2-factor authentication the user will be redirected to his/her profile page.
